- analytical analysis
- Otters (those lil brown haired floating guys)

These lines above is all the gibberish you'll read on my page. If you're all about this corporate nonsense go have a look at my linkedin.

Oooh you continued reading? gladd so see you're here for the real stuff.

Sadly, recruiters rarely look at your GitHub, assuming they even know what Git is. They only care about those pseudo-science color wheels (like the disc model). For those interested I classify as color #000. 

I'm not interested in what your color is (sorry not sorry), please tell me about your interest instead! From useless funfacts to projects or hobbies. (I can guarantee that I will get a better undertanding about you as a person than those color wheels can, just by asking these simple questions). 

Here is a funfact for you, Taylor Swift uses 6 Boeing 747 freighters to move her stage around the world during her tour. Yes, this is next to the 2 private jets she owns.
